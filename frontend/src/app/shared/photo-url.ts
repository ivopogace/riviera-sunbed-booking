 * served same-origin (`apiBaseUrl` is `''`) so this is a no-op — but in local dev the API
 * lives on another origin (`localhost:8080`), and an unprefixed `<img src>` would resolve against
 * the Angular dev server and 404. Applied once, at the HTTP-service boundary, so components and
 * templates keep treating photo URLs as opaque strings.
